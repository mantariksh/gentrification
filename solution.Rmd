The [Urban Displacement Project](http://www.urbandisplacement.org/) (UDP) is a 
collaborative research initiative by UC Berkeley, UCLA, and Portland State 
University. Its aim is to understand the nature of gentrification and 
displacement in American cities, and one of its major areas of focus is San 
Francisco.  

UDP has published a list of gentrification "typologies". This is a framework by 
which census tracts can be classified according to the extent of gentrification
and exclusion taking place within them. Note that gentrification refers to 
demographic shifts in historically disinvested neighborhoods, often 
corresponding to the displacement of low-income residents, whereas exclusion 
refers to increasing barriers for low-income residents to move into an area.  

UDP's map of San Francisco, colored by typology, is available [here](http://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf). The first task in this 
challenge is to recreate this map.  

First, we need to get the shapes of the census tracts. From the [ACS data website](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t), download the shapefile for census tracts as follows:  

1.  Select the "Census Tract - 140" geography for all census tracts in 
California  
2.  Select dataset ID S0101 (Age and Sex)  
3.  Select "Create a Map" and make a map of the variable "Total population"  
4.  Download the shapefiles and transfer all of them into your data directory. 

Note that when calling `read_sf()`, you should read in the .shp file.  

__q1.1__ `file_typologies` contains the typology of some census tracts in the 
Bay Area under the column `Typology`, while `file_udp_data` contains the 
typologies under the column `disp_descr` as well as several other variables used
to create the typologies. Both files are raw data obtained from the UDP 
researchers. Note that `file_udp_data` contains data on fewer census tracts than
`file_typologies`.

Use `count` to look at the typology results in both files. What major 
differences do you notice?

Read in both files so we can compare them.

```{r}
udp_data <- 
  file_udp %>% 
  readxl::read_excel(sheet = "data")
typologies <- 
  file_typologies %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  select(geo_fips, Typology)
```

Compare the tract IDs in both.

```{r}
nrow(typologies) - nrow(udp_data)
```

`typologies` contains data on 551 more census tracts than `udp_data`.

```{r}
setdiff(
  udp_data %>% pull(tract_id),
  typologies %>% pull(geo_fips)
)
```

All the tract IDs that are in `udp_data` are also in `typologies`.


```{r}
udp_data %>% 
  select(tract_id, disp_descr) %>% 
  count(disp_descr)
```

```{r}
typologies %>% 
  count(Typology)
```

Doing a count for both files, it is clear that the terminology used in both is
not consistent. `typologies` makes a distinction between gentrification and
exclusion, while `udp_data` makes no such distinction, and seems to only make
distinctions by extent of gentrification and income. This is seen from the fact
that `udp_data` contains categories for "Undergoing displacement" for both
low income and moderate-to-high income.  

__q1.2__ `file_typologies` contains typology results that are more consistent
with the map we are trying to recreate, so we will use it for mapping. However,
`file_typologies` has no way to filter the tracts by city, so we have to use the
filtered census tract IDs in `file_udp_data` to determine which tracts to map.
Join the typologies data with the geographies you just downloaded, and use the 
color values in `typology_colors` to recreate the UDP map for the city of San
Francisco. What conclusions can you draw?  

Note that your map will look a little different from the original, partially
because the original uses base maps, and partially because the original uses
striped colors for "Advanced Gentrification" that are hard to recreate in R.  

Hints:  

* Make sure to use `st_transform` with the WGS84 projection defined above.
* Use [this website](http://www.usboundary.com/Areas/) on census tract
boundaries to find out which tract you could filter out to better focus on the
main peninsula, rather than the offshore islands.

```{r}
tracts <- 
  file_tracts %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  mutate(
    GEO_ID = 
      str_remove(GEO_ID, "\\d+US") %>% 
      as.double()
  ) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = WGS84)
```
```{r, fig.asp=1}
udp_data %>% 
  filter(city == "San Francisco") %>% 
  select(tract_id) %>% 
  filter(tract_id != 6075017902) %>% 
  left_join(typologies, by = c("tract_id" = "geo_fips")) %>% 
  left_join(tracts, by = c("tract_id" = "GEO_ID")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = Typology)) +
  geom_sf(size = 0.1, color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = typology_colors) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  guides(
    fill = 
      guide_legend(
        title.position = "top",
        ncol = 2
      )
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "San Francisco census tracts by gentrification typology",
    caption = "Source: Urban Displacement Project"
  )
# Print results
if (exists("q1.2")) q1.2

# Compare result with answer
if (exists("q1.2")) knitr::include_graphics("data/q1_2.png")
```
The areas being gentrified and the areas under exclusion tend to cluster 
together. Moreover, even within the clusters of tracts being gentrified, 
those which are advanced tend to cluster together. Since all the gentrification
typologies are low-income except "Advanced Gentrification", this suggests that
there are high-income pockets clustered together amongst low-income gentrifying
pockets.  

__q2__ Gentrification and exclusion are deeply rooted in historical state 
policies. In this question, we explore the history of redlining, where certain
areas were identified by the state as less worth of investment because they
contained high proportions of minority populations.  

The [Mapping Inequality Project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8) at the University of Richmond has made shapefiles available which 
identify exactly how areas were redlined in the past. Download the shapefiles 
for San Francisco (use the cloud icon next to the label "San Francisco, CA")
and add them to your data directory.  

Overlay the redlining data from the mapping inequality project with the plot
you created in q1.2. What conclusions can you draw?

Hints:  

* Again, remember to use `st_transform` to make the projections of the two
shapefiles consistent.  
* Use `alpha` to make the colors more clear in the overlay.  
* Note that `ggplot` does not allow multiple legends for the same aesthetic.
Think of ways in which you can separate the legends for the redlining zones
and the gentrification typologies!  

```{r}
redlining <- 
  file_redlining %>% 
  read_sf() %>% 
  st_transform(crs = WGS84)
```
```{r, fig.asp=1}
udp_data %>% 
  filter(city == "San Francisco") %>% 
  select(tract_id) %>% 
  filter(tract_id != 6075017902) %>% 
  left_join(typologies, by = c("tract_id" = "geo_fips")) %>% 
  left_join(tracts, by = c("tract_id" = "GEO_ID")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = Typology)) +
  geom_sf(size = 0.1, color = "white", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_sf(
    aes(fill = holc_grade),
    data = redlining,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.3
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    breaks = 
      c(
        redlining_colors %>% names(),
        typology_colors %>% names()
      ),
    values = c(typology_colors, redlining_colors)
  ) +
  guides(
    fill = 
      guide_legend(
        title.position = "top",
        ncol = 4
      )
  ) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 6)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "San Francisco census tracts by gentrification typology",
    subtitle = 
      "Overlay shows close correlation with HOLC redlining grade from 1930s",
    fill = "Grade   Typology",
    caption = "Source: Urban Displacement Project and University of Richmond"
  )
# Print results
if (exists("q2")) q2

# Compare result with answer
if (exists("q2")) knitr::include_graphics("data/q2.png")

```


In general, the areas being gentrified correspond closely to the areas that
got the lowest HOLC grade, while the areas under exclusion correspond to higher
HOLC grades. The policies of the 1930s-1940s thus clearly had a close 
correlation with housing inequality today.

There are some exceptions: in the east of the city, there is a tract that is
classified as under exclusion but was redlining grade "D", whereas in the west,
there is a tract that is undergoing advanced gentrification and was redlining
grade "B". This suggests that there are probably pockets of the city whose
income demographics have changed significantly since the 1930s and 1940s.

__q3.1__ Next, we will try to understand how current patterns of housing
construction relate to housing inequality.  

Every quarter, the San Francisco Planning Department releases a "Development
Pipeline" document which lists all the current construction projects in the 
city. This document includes the total number of units being constructed, as 
well as how many of those units constitute affordable housing.  

The data for every quarter from 2013-2017 has been downloaded, cleaned, and 
stored for you in `file_pipeline`. However, the `coordinates` column must be
converted into a geometrical object before we can map the data.  

Read in the data, and use the `st_as_sf` function to convert the coordinates 
into simple geometrical objects.  

Hints:  

* The coordinates column is in the format (latitude, longitude). Use `separate` 
and `str_extract` to get those numbers as separate columns.  
* `st_as_sf` takes a `coords` argument in the form (longitude, latitude). You
can filter for rows that have non-NA values for both coordinates.

```{r}
q3.1 <- 
  file_pipeline %>% 
  read_rds() %>% 
  separate(col = coords, into = c("lat", "lng"), sep = ",\\s*") %>% 
  mutate(
    lat = str_extract(lat, "-?\\d+.?\\d*") %>% as.numeric(),
    lng = str_extract(lng, "-?\\d+.?\\d*") %>% as.numeric()
  ) %>% 
  filter_at(
    vars(lat, lng),
    all_vars(!is.na(.))
  ) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"))
# Print results
if (exists("q3.1")) q3.1
```

__q3.2__ Plot the net units built (`net_units`) and net affordable units built
(`net_aff_units`) on an annual basis on the same axes. What conclusions can you
draw?
```{r}
q3.1 %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(
    net_units = sum(net_units, na.rm = TRUE),
    net_aff_units = sum(net_aff_units, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  gather(ends_with("units"), key = type, value = num_units, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    type = 
      factor(
        type, 
        levels = c("net_units", "net_aff_units"), 
        labels = c("Overall", "Affordable")
      )
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, num_units, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

The total construction was always much greater than the number of affordable
units built. Moreover, the affordable unit construction did not keep pace with
overall construction: when overall construction started increasing in 2008,
affordable unit construction lagged behind by several years.

There was a dip in construction in 2012, probably due to housing market prices.


__q3.3__ Make a heatmap of the net affordable units built in the year 2010, then
make another one for the year 2016. Compare these to your map in q1.2. What
conclusions can you draw? How might the gentrification typologies have been
useful to construction planners back in 2010?

```{r}
q3.1 %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addHeatmap(
    intensity = ~ net_aff_units,
    radius = 20
  )
```

```{r}
q3.1 %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2016) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addHeatmap(
    intensity = ~ net_aff_units,
    radius = 20
  )
```

In 2010, construction of affordable units was really only focused on Bayview, 
a known low-income and underinvested area. However, in 2016, the 
construction of affordable housing has spread out to areas that very closely 
match the gentrifying areas seen in q1. If construction planners had known about
gentrification typologies sooner, perhaps they could have encouraged more 
affordable unit construction in gentrifying areas to reduce the negative
effects of displacement.

__q4__ `file_udp` contains several variables other than the gentrification
typologies, which are described under the "_documentation" tab. Explore this 
data. What conclusions can you draw?  

Hints:  

* If you're having trouble looking for a place to start, think about who the
gentrifiers could be. Are they of a particular race, or income, or educational
attainment level? How can you tell, perhaps by comparison to earlier plots?  
* If you are planning to map multiple variables, consider writing a helper 
function.  

```{r}
plot_across_years <- 
  function(start_year_var, end_year_var, start_year, end_year) {
    udp_data %>% 
      filter(city == "San Francisco") %>% 
      filter(tract_id != 6075017902) %>% 
      select(tract_id, !! enquo(start_year_var), !! enquo(end_year_var)) %>% 
      gather(key = year, value = value, start_year_var, end_year_var) %>% 
      mutate(
        year =
          case_when(
            year == start_year_var ~ start_year,
            year == end_year_var ~ end_year
          )
      ) %>% 
      left_join(tracts, by = c("tract_id" = "GEO_ID")) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(fill = value)) +
      geom_sf(size = 0.1, color = "white") + 
      coord_sf(datum = NA) +
      scale_fill_continuous(
        labels = scales::percent
      ) +
      guides(
        fill =
          guide_colorbar(
            title.hjust = 0.5,
            title.position = "top",
            barwidth = 20
          )
      ) +
      theme_void() +
      theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
      ) +
      facet_grid(. ~ year) +
      labs(
        caption = "Source: Urban Displacement Project"
      )
  }
```


```{r, fig.asp=1}
plot_across_years("white_90", "white_13", "1990", "2009-2013") +
  labs(
    title = "Census tracts in San Francisco by % non-white population",
    fill = "% non-white population"
  )
```

Surprisingly, the percentage of non-white people in each census tract does not
seem to have changed much in San Francisco since 1990. However, we can see that
in the eastern part of the city which is being gentrified, the non-white
percentage has decreased slightly. It is possible that this indicates that the gentrifiers are not necessarily white, but simply people with higher income. We
can test this using the percentage of college-educated adults.

```{r, fig.asp=1}
plot_across_years("ed90_00", "ed00_13", "1990-2000", "2000-2013") +
  scale_fill_gradient2() +
  labs(
    title = 
      "Census tracts in San Francisco by % change in college-educated adults",
    fill = "% change in college-educated adults"
  )
```
In almost all areas of the city, there has been a positive change in the
percentage of college-educated adults, which is perhaps a reflection of better
educational attainment overall. However, the map for 2000-2013 shows that this percentage has increased even more in some areas that are being gentrified. This
could mean that the gentrifiers are more highly-educated people moving into lower-income districts.
